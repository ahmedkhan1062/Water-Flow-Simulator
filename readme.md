This program is a waterflow simulator designed to visualise the flow of a water current across a terrain.

The program was designed to be run in a linux environment via the command line using Make Files.

My program can be launched with two different make commands: runMedium and
runLarge. This depends on whether you want to run the medium terrain or the
large one.
