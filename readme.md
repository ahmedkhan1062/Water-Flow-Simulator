This program is a waterflow simulator designed to visualise the flow of a water current across a terrain.

The instructions for the assignment are included in the pdf file: WaterflowSimulator_Assignment_Instructions.pdf

A video demo of the program functionality given by the UCT CS course convenor can also be found in the file assignmentdemo.mp4

The program was designed to be run in a linux environment via the command line using Make Files.

My program can be launched with two different make commands: "make runMedium" and
"make runLarge". This depends on whether you want to run the medium terrain or the
large one.

All project files can be found inside the "src" folder
